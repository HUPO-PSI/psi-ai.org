    "text": "Raw data: define “mzPeak minimum information” so reprocessing is feasible\nThe raw-data group focused on the minimum metadata needed to make peak-level representations reprocessable and interoperable at scale. In light of the development of the new mzPeak format (Van Den Bossche et al. 2025), the discussion centred on capturing (a) per run, essential acquisition context (instrument model and software version; separation technology details including LC gradient/mobile phases/column information; ion mobility or imaging parameters where relevant; ionization type; acquisition mode) and, (b) per scan, the key analytical settings (mass analyzer, scan range, collision energy/type, MS level, precursor and isolation window where applicable). The point was pragmatic: without these elements, it becomes difficult to compare datasets, reproduce processing choices, or support systematic reprocessing—regardless of whether the downstream consumer is a human or an ML pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePSI-AI action points\n\n\n\nFor PSI-AI, the immediate step is to translate this minimum-information set into a machine-checkable checklist aligned to controlled vocabularies and to explore how much can be recovered from existing submissions versus what must be captured earlier (during acquisition / before submission). Coordination with the mzPeak team and with ProteomeXchange (Eric W. Deutsch et al. 2025) stakeholders was viewed as important to ensure any checklist can be validated and incentivized in real deposition workflows."

    "section": "Identification: improve interpretability of peptidoforms, scores, and spectrum links",
    "text": "Identification: improve interpretability of peptidoforms, scores, and spectrum links\nThe identification group discussed three recurring challenges: encoding modified sequences in a way that remains machine-interpretable, communicating confidence/uncertainty in a reusable manner, and reliably linking reported identifications back to spectra. Participants noted that ProForma (LeDuc et al. 2022) is already widely used, but that reuse would improve if modifications were consistently represented using stable identifiers when possible, if localization probabilities were included when available, and if the community explored better ways to represent residue-level certainty (including for de novo outputs).\nA second theme was that many identification scores and q-values are not purely spectrum-local; they depend on dataset-wide modelling and upstream spectrum processing, complicating comparability and reuse for ML. This motivated calls for better capture of processing algorithms and, where appropriate, sharing the processed peak lists that determined the PSM scores alongside the raw data. In this light, participants highlighted mzSpecLib (Klein et al. 2024) as an important basis for spectral library exchange, while acknowledging the need for more scalable serializations (e.g., Parquet-based) and tooling for very large libraries, especially in DIA contexts. Finally, the group strongly endorsed USI (Eric W. Deutsch et al. 2021) as a foundational mechanism for resolvable spectrum-level references in public repositories, while noting ongoing confusion around commonly used spectrum identifiers (like scan number (MS:1003057) and spectrum title (MS:1000796)) and vendor-specific native IDs (MS:1000767) (also see OpenMS docs for examples).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePSI-AI action points\n\n\n\nFor PSI-AI, suggested next steps include drafting practical guidance on recommended ProForma usage in common outputs, advancing scalable and DIA-ready spectral library sharing in coordination with mzSpecLib, and pushing USI-first linking as a default best practice in tools, manuscripts, and repository submissions."

    "text": "Quantification: An “mzQuant” container that records how numbers were produced\nThe quantification group discussed the limitation of downstream reuse by the absence of quantitative tables that preserve the full data processing history. A proposed direction, informally termed mzQuant, is a multi-layer quantitative matrix container inspired by the AnnData format (Virshup et al. 2024), where a declared primary matrix (PSM/peptide/protein/protein group) can be accompanied by additional layers (raw, normalized, batch-corrected, imputed, summarized, statistical outputs). The critical requirement is that each layer carries structured descriptions of methods and assumptions, parameters, and software versions - so results are not just shareable, but auditable and reproducible.\nParticipants emphasized that the container must embed experimental design in an SDRF-compatible form (Dai et al. 2021) (groups, contrasts, blocking/randomization, and explicit linkage to raw files), and that adoption hinges on low-friction integration with existing and frequently used environments including search engines, statistical tools, etc.\nIn parallel, the group saw a clear opportunity for AI-based added value of such a format by (i) using LLMs to generate SDRF files based on experimental design; (ii) automatically complete mzQuant by extracting e.g. normalization methods directly from the code; (iii) use the layers of mzQuant and SDRF to automatically generate Materials and Methods sections and describe the computational analysis process in a human readable format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePSI-AI action points\n\n\n\nShort-term PSI-AI action items are to draft a minimal schema and reference layout for mzQuant, to run a controlled vocabulary/ontology gap analysis (the PSI-MS controlled vocabulary (Mayer et al. 2013) and broader biomedical data ontologies), and to deliver reference implementations in common programming languages, a validator, and practical examples including deliberate “bad” cases."
