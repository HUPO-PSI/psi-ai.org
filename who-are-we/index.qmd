# Co-chairs

PSI-AI is led by a team of co-chairs who coordinate the working group's strategy, prioritization, and delivery across the HUPO-PSI community. They ensure alignment with other PSI working groups and external stakeholders, and facilitate consensus on standards, guidelines, and resources that make proteomics data and workflows fit for modern AI/ML use.
