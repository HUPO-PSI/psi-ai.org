## Mission

The HUPO-PSI AI-readiness Working Group bridges the gap between proteomics data and the use of artificial intelligence. We focus on two complementary goals. The first is to make public proteomics data suitable for AI applications. The second is to support and standardize the use of AI in workflows that generate new data. We work toward these goals through the use of community standards and reproducible and accessible pipelines. Our aim is to integrate with, not duplicate, existing infrastructure and community efforts.

## Key Objectives
